# Titanic Data Analysis Project

Welcome to my Titanic Data Analysis project! In this project, I'll be exploring the famous Titanic dataset and using various data analysis techniques to gain insights and make predictions about the survival of passengers on board.

## Introduction

The Titanic dataset is a well-known dataset in the data science community, often used as a beginner's project due to its size and interesting nature. It contains various information about the passengers on board the Titanic, such as their age, sex, ticket class, and whether they survived or not.

## Project Goals

The main goals of this project are as follows:

1. Explore the Data: Get familiar with the dataset, examine its structure, and gain insights into the characteristics of the passengers.

2. Preprocess the Data: Clean up the dataset by handling missing values, transforming categorical variables, and preparing it for analysis.

3. Choose a Model: Select a suitable machine learning model to predict the survival of passengers based on the available features.

4. Make Predictions: Train the chosen model on the training data and make predictions on the test data to determine the survival outcomes.

5. Evaluate and Share Findings: Evaluate the performance of the model using appropriate metrics and share the findings and insights gained from the analysis.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following sections:

1. **Data Exploration**: In this section, I will examine the dataset, check for missing values, and perform exploratory data analysis to gain initial insights.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Here, I will handle missing values, transform categorical variables into numerical format, and prepare the data for modeling.

3. **Model Selection and Training**: I will select a suitable machine learning model, split the data into training and validation sets, and train the model using the training data.

4. **Model Evaluation and Predictions**: This section involves evaluating the trained model using appropriate evaluation metrics and making predictions on the test data.

5. **Results and Conclusions**: Finally, I will summarize the findings, share any interesting insights gained from the analysis, and discuss potential areas of improvement.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ````
   git clone github.com/faisalgh1/Titanic
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies by running:
   ````
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to access the project code and follow along with the analysis.

## Dependencies

The project has the following dependencies:

- pandas
- scikit-learn
- catboost

Ensure that these dependencies are installed before running the code.

## Model Selection and Training

When it comes to selecting a machine learning model for the Titanic dataset, I explored different options and considered the specific requirements of the project. Two models stood out: XGBoost and HistGradientBoostingClassifier.

XGBoost:
- Learning Speed and Efficiency: XGBoost is known for its speed and efficiency in learning. It utilizes advanced techniques that make it a speed demon in the world of machine learning.
- Handling Large Datasets: XGBoost is designed to handle large datasets effortlessly. If you have a Titanic-sized dataset, XGBoost won't break a sweat.

HistGradientBoostingClassifier:
- Learning Speed and Efficiency: The HistGradientBoostingClassifier is no slouch either. It leverages histogram-based learning techniques to handle lots of data efficiently. This makes it a great choice for the Titanic dataset's size.
- Handling Large Datasets: Similar to XGBoost, the HistGradientBoostingClassifier is well-equipped to handle large datasets, thanks to its histogram-based approach.

Choosing Your Model:
- For speed and efficiency, XGBoost is like the Usain Bolt of machine learning models.
- If you have a Titanic-sized dataset and need efficiency, both XGBoost and the HistGradientBoostingClassifier are solid choices.

In my implementation, I decided to go with the XGBoost model. Its speed and efficiency, along with its ability to handle large datasets, were appealing for this project. I trained the XGBoost model on the training data and evaluated its performance on a validation set. After 100 iterations, the model achieved a final validation log loss of 0.56925 and an accuracy of 80.6%.
